We will use the basic Google Python style guide located at: https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md

Things that we will modify for us will be:

Use lower camel case for naming functions and variables and upper camel case for classes.

Use all caps for constants.

We will use the latest version of Django 2.
